Sentiment analysis is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) technique used to determine whether a given text expresses a positive, negative, or neutral sentiment. By leveraging TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) Vectorization, we convert textual data into numerical form, and using Logistic Regression, we classify the sentiment of customer reviews.
